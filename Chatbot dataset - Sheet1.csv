That would be pretty cool. I would also love to see a building that communicates towards the main TUM campus, because the building as it is doesn't really open up to the Theresienstraße. As many Civil and Environmental Engineers work in the Nordbau, it should definitely have a connection to that department as well. The TUM doesn't have a timber building at the Stammgelände, so it would be nice to see that the TUM actually cares about progressional architecture and provides us with a new timber faculty building.
